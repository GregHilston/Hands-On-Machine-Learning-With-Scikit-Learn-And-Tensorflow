    "## Part A: Frame the Problem and Look at the Big Picture\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Define the objective in business terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Pretend) We want to predict real estate valuations in New Taipei City, Taiwan to increase our ability to effectively bid on lots.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How will your solution be used?\n",
    "\n",
    "(Pretend) Our solution will be used to ensure we our bids are accurate, maximizing profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What are the current solutions/workarounds (if any)?\n",
    "\n",
    "None.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How should you frame this problem (supervised/unsupervised, online/offline, etc.)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised. The data sets have valuation attached. \n",
    "\n",
    "Offline. All the data that existed has been already gathered and all the training will be done at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How should performance be measured?\n",
    "\n",
    "I was going to use MSE, but the outlier will make my MSE very high\n",
    "Performance should be measured by Mean Square Error (MSE). I have chosen this metric \n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience, the equation is listed here: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large{\\text{MSE} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - y_i^p)^2}{n}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE was chosen to ensure that the bigger the magnitude of the difference between the predictio and the actual, the worse it is penalized. This would allow us to ensure we minimize the amount of money we might lose on any given bid.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objective?\n",
    "\n",
    "TBD\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What are comparable problems? Can you reuse experience or tools?\n",
    "\n",
    "(Pretend) Our company has had no comparable problems, nor can we reuse experience or tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Is human expertise available?\n",
    "\n",
    "(Pretend) No.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. How would you solve the problem manually?\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd attempt to solve this problem manually by looking at all the houses that sold for the most amount and the houses that sold for the least amount and look for patterns that may elude to what would effect each house's price.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. List the assumptions you (or others) have made so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - valuation and transaction date will have a positive correlation\n",
    "    - generally real estate gets more valuable with time, along with inflation increasing the value\n",
    "  - valuation and house age will have a negative correlation\n",
    "    - part of me believes a newer house will be worth more, but there's also part of me thinking older homes may be have been larger due to less people and more available land back then\n",
    "  - valuation and distance to the nearest MRT station will have a negative correlation\n",
    "    - I believe the closer a house is to an MRT station, the more likely it is to be in an urban setting and therefore more likely to fetch a higher valuation\n",
    "  - valuation and number of convenience stores will have a negative correlation\n",
    "    - I believe the moreconvenience stores near a house, the more likely it is to be in an urban setting and therefore more likely to fetch a higher valuation\n",
    "  - valuation and latitude will have a postiive correlation\n",
    "    - New Taipei City is a city bordered by water to the north, so I believe these coastal locations will be worth more\n",
    "  - no assumption for valuation and longitude\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Verify assumptions if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Will do."

Or just drop the rows?). Unless there are very few hyperparameter values to explore, prefer random search over grid search. If training is very long, you may prefer a Bayesian optimization approach (e.g., using Gaussian process priors, as described by Jasper Snoek, Hugo Larochelle, and Ryan Adams).\n",
    "\n",
